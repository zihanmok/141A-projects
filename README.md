# Project 1:
#Monopoly Simulation
Used R to simulate the Monopoly Game which plays on a board with 40 squares. Expected a player to play the game n turn with two d side dices. The goal of this project was to estimate the long-term probabilities of landing on each square under different choices and senarios.


# Project 2:
# KNN algorithm/10-folds cross validation of picture classification
Used R to classified the picture with KNN algorithm. In the project, the distance was measured by the Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance with the different value of k (0 to 15). To speed up the algorithm, we calculated all the distance matrix outside of the function. Furthermore, we maximized the use of vectorized operations, which is faster than using for-loops. We also carried out the error rate using 10-folds cross validation for differnt k and metric.
